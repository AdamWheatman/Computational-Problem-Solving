The Python File "Custom Ordering System" is a response to the following briefing: 

Devise the Algorithms that a first-aid kit manufaturer will need to hold the data for their orders and inventory. 
Additionally, They will need to create and order, delete an order, or modify an order. 
An order will consist of a kit specification made up of five items. Each part has a unique four-digit code numbe, and there are five parts per model
They will typically sell less than 20 of any kit per mont.


The Python File "More Uniform ordering System" is a response to the following briefing:

The orginal first-aid kit manufacturer has been taken over by a new company, they will not be allowing cusotmised kits anymore and it is estimated that 100 kits will be sold per month
The kits will need to be more uniform, sold complete, with no customised items being ordered, but models will be ordered in bulk quantities.
your previous solution will no longer be suitable. Devise a new algorithm using a diffent abstract data types to account for the new type of models offered.


The Python Files which judge the Algorithmic Complexity of the previous two models are due to the following briefing:

After six months the company wants to know if the algorithms made a difference. 
Create a report describing the differences of Algorithmic Complexity, performance, and resource usage (more specfically memory usage).
